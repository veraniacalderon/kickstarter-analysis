# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:
	
### Purpose
	Louise's play Fever needs information on past fundraising goals also relating to their launch
	dates to see how she can improve and meet future goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

	Analysising the data from the Kickstarter, i was able to gather information to show the 
	outcome based on launch dates. A visible chart and graph is included to show Louise a visible 
	representation of the information gathered. Including outcomes based on goals that were 
	included in the Kickstarter data.  Challenges were met. Analizing the data and converting it 	
	into line graphs was a bit difficult to do. That was not completed. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	Easier to gather. Data was collected from Kickstarter and was able to transfer into a graph 	
	and table. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	Easier to put into rows and columns. Difficult to translate into a line graph. Needed more 
	explanation. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Line charts where not helpful to convert . Prating more in excel is definitely something that
	needs to be practiced. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Succession rates were higher in January but Feb Jul and Oct weren't too far behind. 
	The most failed plays were between Feb and April.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	 The highest percentage was 55.9% for the goals between 1000 to 4999 because it was more 
	ideal.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	It closed off to a certain time frame, and category. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	A table for staffs picks for recommendations to the audience and the currency to see where to 
	market.
